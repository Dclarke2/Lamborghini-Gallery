The Huracán made its worldwide debut at the 2014 Geneva Auto Show, and was released in the market the second quarter of 2014. The LP 610-4 designation comes from the fact that this car has 610 metric horsepower and 4 wheel drive, while LP stands for \"Longitudinale Posteriore\", which refers to the longitudinal mid-rear engine position. The Huracán was named \"The Supercar of the Year 2014\" by automotive magazine <strong>Top Gear</strong>.</p>";
